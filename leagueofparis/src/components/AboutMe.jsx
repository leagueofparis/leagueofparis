			<p className="text-base text-center">
				Hi there! My name is Paris and I am a brand new streamer who jumped into
				the world of gaming and content creation in January of 2025.
			</p>
			<p className="text-base text-center">
				While I may be new to streaming, and gaming in general, I have already
				fallen in love with it. I mainly play League of Legends, but
				occasionally dabble in Minecraft (creative only, because survival is
				scary), Repo, and intense Mario Kart games on Wii against my brothersâ€¦
				which probably shaped most of my competitiveness and my trust issues.
			</p>
			<p className="text-base text-center">
				I work full time for a non profit during the days, and at night gaming
				and streaming have become my favorite way to turn off my brainâ€¦ by
				getting destroyed on the rift.
			</p>
			<p className="text-base text-center">
				I am incredibly grateful for the amazing community thatâ€™s already
				forming. I cannot wait to keep growing, learning, and ranking up both in
				game and in life with you all by my side! So, thanks for being here ðŸ™‚
			</p>
